**How much can you afford to pay?**
My name is ________ and I am from <Your_Country> . As you may know that my country is impoverished. As a student, I do not have any special source of income, but things get even worse when you are a student. I live only on my scholarship ($___ per annum). I can't pay for this course. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. I want to take this course as I want to complete the Deep learning.ai Specialization (EDIT THIS) on Coursera. I can barely feed myself and pay for a dorm with the money I have. For me, it seems impossible to pay for an entire course by myself. My parents can't help me, either. So, I would say that the main reason I 'm asking you for the Financial Aid is the circumstances due to which I happened to born in a lovely country – <Your_Country>. Receiving this Financial Aid will open for me new horizons of the world of Coursera courses, which in turn will help me in future. I wanted to take this specialization but couldn't afford it; hence, I decided to apply for Financial Aid.
The financial Aid will help me take the course, and I will be able to learn more about deep learning

**How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?**
From my childhood, I have always been very interested in learning more about computers and how they work.  I will choose my speciality as well as my future job based on my interest. Which happens to be deep learning. I am fascinated by deep learning and how it enables computers to perform seemingly impossible tasks. I firmly believe that doing your job as a hobby will allow you to reach a very high place. This principle has helped me a lot during my studying and I hope it will help in future as well. I have already mentioned, I make my speciality to be my hobby, and vice versa). I'm interested in taking the deeplearning.ai specialization. This field is one of the topics which I will face in future. Employed on a full-time basis as a Machine Learning specialist. Taking this course would help me learn more about deep learning and neural networks.
